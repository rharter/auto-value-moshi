# AutoValue: Moshi Extension

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rharter/auto-value-moshi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rharter/auto-value-moshi)

An extension for Google's [AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto) that creates a simple [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) JsonAdapterFactory for each AutoValue annotated object.

## Usage

Simply include auto-value-moshi in your project and add a public static method with the following
signature to classes you want to get Moshi `JsonAdapter`s. You can also annotate your properties
using `@Json` to define an alternate name for de/serialization.

```java
@AutoValue public abstract class Foo {
  abstract String bar();
  @Json(name="Baz") abstract String baz();

  public static JsonAdapter<Foo> jsonAdapter(Moshi moshi) {
    return new AutoValue_Foo.MoshiJsonAdapter(moshi);
  }
}

final Moshi moshi = new Moshi.Builder()
    .add(new AutoValueMoshiAdapterFactory())
    .build();
```

Now build your project and de/serialize your Foo.

In addition to generating implementations of your `@AutoValue` annotated classes, auto-value-moshi 
also generates an `AutoValueMoshiAdapterFactory` class which you can register with Moshi to 
automatically add all of your generated JsonAdapters. If you want to customize the generated class, 
you can specify the corresponding `moshiAdapterPackage` and `moshiAdapterName` processing args like
so:

```gradle
apt {
 arguments {
   moshiAdapterPackage 'com.example'
   moshiAdapterName 'AdapterFactory'
 }
}
```

## Download
