# AutoValue: Moshi Extension

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rharter/auto-value-moshi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rharter/auto-value-moshi)

An extension for Google's [AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto) that creates a simple [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) JsonAdapterFactory for each AutoValue annotated object.

## Usage

Simply include auto-value-moshi in your project and add a public static method with the following
signature to classes you want to get Moshi `JsonAdapter`s. You can also annotate your properties
using `@Json` to define an alternate name for de/serialization.

```java
@AutoValue public abstract class Foo {
  abstract String bar();
  @Json(name="Baz") abstract String baz();

  public static JsonAdapter<Foo> jsonAdapter(Moshi moshi) {
    return new AutoValue_Foo.MoshiJsonAdapter(moshi);
  }
}
```

Now build your project and de/serialize your Foo.

## Generics support

If the annotated class uses generics, the static method needs a little modification. Simply add a `Type[]` parameter and pass it to the generated `MoshiJsonAdapter` class.

```java
@AutoValue public abstract class Foo<T> {
    abstract T data();
    
    public static JsonAdapter<Foo<T>> jsonAdapter(Moshi moshi, Type[] types) {
        return new AutoValue_Foo.MoshiJsonAdapter(moshi, types);
    }
}
```

## Factory

Optionally, auto-value-moshi can create a single [JsonAdapter.Factory](http://square.github.io/moshi/1.x/moshi/com/squareup/moshi/JsonAdapter.Factory.html) so
that you don't have to add each generated JsonAdapter to your Moshi instance manually.

To generate a `JsonAdapter.Factory` for all of your auto-value-moshi classes, simply create
an abstract class that implements `JsonAdapter.Factory` and annotate it with `@MoshiAdapterFactory`,
and auto-value-moshi will create an implementation for you.  You simply need to provide a static
factory method, just like your AutoValue classes, and you can use the generated `JsonAdapter.Factory`
to help Moshi de/serialize your types.

```java
@MoshiAdapterFactory
public abstract class MyAdapterFactory implements JsonAdapter.Factory {

  // Static factory method to access the package
  // private generated implementation
  public static JsonAdapter.Factory create() {
    return new AutoValueMoshi_MyAdapterFactory();
  }
  
}
```

Then you simply need to register the Factory with Moshi.

```java
Moshi moshi = new Moshi.Builder()
    .add(MyAdapterFactory.create())
    .build();
```

## Download

Add a Gradle dependency:

```kotlin
annotationProcessor("com.ryanharter.auto.value:auto-value-moshi:0.4.5")
implementation("com.ryanharter.auto.value:auto-value-moshi-annotations:0.4.5")
```
